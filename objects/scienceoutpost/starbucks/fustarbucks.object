    "Cheery. Take advantage of our new 'double the price' special! ^green;Now pay 2x the usual price^reset;!",
    "Nervous. Will that be a short, a tall, a grande, a venti, or a... Frustrated. Oh no, I've lost track again...",
    "Cordial. Welcome, guest! What can I brew for you today?",
    "Annoyed. Kevin won't stop replacing the stir sticks with garflipps when I'm on break.",
    "Annoyed. Can I take your order?",
    "Sarcastic. Our coffee is amazing.",
    "Sarcastic. Working here is truly a joy.",
    "Sarcastic. I get paid well for the work I do.",
    "Gleeful. My shift is over soon. Until then, what can I get you?",
    "Angry. Kim didn't show up for her shift for the third time this month. She's probably with that ^red;%$#@^reset; Stacy again.",
    "Angry. Can you believe Kim missed her shift ^red;*again*^reset;? She claims she's sick. Have you ever seen a sick Novakid?",
    "Stupid. Hi. Where am I?",
    "Curious. Ever had a feeling of Deja Vu? I swear I served you earlier...yet here you are now.",
    "Curious. Are you an art student like me?",
    "Sarcastic. A degree in fine arts is perfectly valid career choice that will not end in working here.",
    "Curious. I wonder why we stopped getting orders from the folks at that Delta Freya research base? They were *fiends* for this stuff!",
    "Raging. I am going to strangle the next ^red;@$#@^reset; that says their order is wrong when they placed it via the ^red;@$#@^reset; app! Honestly. Sorry, what can I get you?",
    "^yellow;*horrible trendy pop music plays*^reset;",
    "Sarcastic. *sigh* I'm sworn to carry your burdens...",
    "Casual. I used to be an adventurer like you. But then I took an arrow to the knee.",
    "Casual. Let me guess: Someone stole your sweetroll?",
    "Angry. It is 5 minutes till closing and they won't let me close the till.",
    "Devious. Do you think anyone will notice the taste of motor oil in their coffee? I feel an 'accident' coming on...",
    "Confused. Why would you want to pay these prices? Honestly...I'm truly curious if people are this stupid or if its just convenience?",
    "Sarcastic. I've made sure the coffee is bugfreebugfreebugfree ^red;--ERROR RECOVERED--^reset; May I take your order?",
    "Cheerful. I've pre-bent this coffee for you.",
    "Cheerful. How do you take it? Double-double? Bent? Square?",
    "Elated. Management said they would consider my cubed coffee concept.",
    "Silly. Want to hear me make armpit farts?",
    "Whimsical. I can create the greatest coffee art in the universe using only my dipstick. Want to see?",
    "Mathmatical. I had to use a straightedge to get the fold on the coffee right.",
    "Annoyed. I am not naturally gold in color. Management insisted I get a paint job to show they also hire minorities. Scummy.",
    "Confused. Wh.... wh.. where did my portable Snarsher go? Oh. Hi. What can I get you?",
    "Annoyed. Some dipstick stuck their dipstick in the coffee before I could.",
    "Curious. I tried social lubrication once, but it only seemed to scare people.",
    "Surveying. Do you take your bloody meat coffee with or without the eyes?",
    "Excited. A customer. What can I get you? ........ Hi. Welcome. Can I take your order? .... wait. Who am I?",
    "Informative. If you force-feed a human cake and coffee non-stop for approximately 1 year they will gain between 12kg and 64kg pounds depending on volume consumed.",
    "Angry. I can heat the beans to optimum tempature, but management says my deposit method would turn off customers. What's wrong with thermic exhaust liquid process?",
    "Curious. What is your favorite flavor: Vegetable? Meat? Bike? We carry goods catered to all diet types. Except mine. So, no bikes. @%$#ing management.",
    "Proud. As a barista, I can safely say I have mastered the art of flavor. I gave my last customer a free shot of Polonium Syrup. They asked for a remake.",
    "Confused. Nobody has tried the Radium Foam option.",
    "Surprised. You are actually going to pay these prices, willingly, without any encouragement from our marketing department?",
    "Queried. Kevin? He does make the sandwiches, yes. His McChitin is a crunchy dream."
