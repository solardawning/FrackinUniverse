  "'From the Twilight Halls we rose, and to them we shall all return.' ; Such was the wisdom the Elder of the Vyanit Clan imparted to me when I asked him why his people lived in such dark and poisonous places.

They are the only known race that villifies solar aspects, rather than deifying them). Take, for instance, their marriage ceremony. It is customary to engage in a 'life-bonding'",
