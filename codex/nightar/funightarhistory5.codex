"Come gather around the fire\n
I'll tell you all a tale\n
The day she came to power\n
Our lives forever changed\n

Never before a darkness like this have we seen\n
No end to suffering\n
All hail our mighty queen\n

There's no hiding from her\n
She sees everything\n
Rules with the iron fist\n
You know she is the matriarch\n

She'll eat your heart\n

I've heard it said \n
That she can melt you with her eyes\n
And out her fingers spits a burning liquid fire\n

Without a single word you'll fall under her spell\n
And rip yourself apart with your bare hands\n
While marching to her bell\n",
"There's no rising above\n
She drowns everything\n
Freedom doesn't exist\n
You can't resist\n

The matriarch\n

You won't get far\n

Oh, she brings nightmares to life\n
The foulmost twisted kind\n
And when you beg to die\n
She glorifies"
