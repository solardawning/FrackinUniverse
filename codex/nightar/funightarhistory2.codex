  "There are mysteries to the Nightar I have recently discovered, though I fought tooth and nail for nearly twenty years to even gain enough trust to ask I have elected to mark down the information for preservation. It will benefit us all to better understand this enigmatic people.",
  "We non-Nightar have often wondered why the Heptarch, despite being publically referred to as their leader, has nothing whatsoever to do with territorial disputes, economics, trade or lawmaking...or any true requirements to keep a civiliation going? The Heptarch is, in all actuality, their military leader only. The true political pull among the Nightar comes from the females.",
  "More specifically, from She, the Great Matriarch, Avemnedara, Mistress of the Way...many names are given to She that Rules. The womenfolk are the only ones permitted to speak of her, or even refer to her. Males who do so must be cleansed through ritual combat followed by Conshak, a 'transfer of energy' from blade to warrior.",
  "How the current Matriarch is chosen is completely unknown, as the women would never tell a male such as myself how their most private sisterhood operates. They speak only that she is the Word, and the Guide, and that Her way is the true path. Through She, they are One. So long as ones fealty is sworn to Her the Burrow is safe."
