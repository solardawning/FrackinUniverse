"Today, my buddy Maple and I found a weird, but adorable little cat-thing. I've never seen anything like it, and Maple insists that it's a cat. I mean, it looks a lot like a cat. It's fluffy, it kinda meows, it has four legs, and it has sharp teeth. It's just... really fat, and drools some sort of nasty metal goo. Makes my skin itch. Maple decided to name our new cat ''Squiggles''.",
"Squiggles acts a lot like a cat. She likes to meow and coo when we scratch her on the cheek, and she nips our ankles when she's upset. Also, she is REALLY fat. Maybe she needs to go on a diet. It gets uncomfortable when she sits in my lap.",
"I heard some sort of screaming a while ago. It sounded like Squiggles, and she paid no mind to it. Maybe there's more like her out there.",
"Squiggles came with us on our ship. SHE IS EATING EVERYTHING. Maple still adores the hell out of the little thing, but damn if we don't get hundreds in property damages from this weird cat eating our ship!",
"I really have a feeling that this isn't a cat.",
"I did some Bloogling and as I suspected, this is no cat. Apparently it's a thing called a Radling? They eat everything in sight, and that dense gooey stuff is liquid. Lead. Liquid lead! No wonder she's so heavy! Also, she's apparently a baby. And she'll grow up into... oh god.",
