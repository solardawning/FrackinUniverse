"Scattered knowledge makes up the entire base of what we know about the race we refer to as the Precursors. Largely because we have no way to know what they called themselves. No text ever speaks of their species identification. Nothing ever mentions a homeworld, star, system...if they were xenophobes they were exceptionally protective and paranoid ones.",
"Fortunately, most scholars aren't me. I came across a ruin...I'll keep the location secret for now. Sasha...you won't believe it! A library. A massive, well-preserved and fully functioning library. The information within is, without a doubt, the most significant archaeological find in the history of the entire cosmos. All I need to do is make it to the meeting on Earth and I can present my findings after the Protectorate emergency summit."
