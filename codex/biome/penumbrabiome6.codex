"Day 6 - /nI found it! Too bad I am so deep in, I'm not sure I could possibly get back out. I found the ore... you can't miss it. It glows with this gentle sky-blue color, lighting entire cave systems up. For some weird reason, the rocks that ate my flashlight beams, don't eat this type of light. I wish I could get a sample of this to a lab... but sadly I don't think I'm going to make it. If anybody finds this... please... take this book back to Earth and give it to my family.../n - M. Hodgins"
