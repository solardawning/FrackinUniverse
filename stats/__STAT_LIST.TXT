NOTICE: 
 > YES, THERE ARE SOME REDUNDANT STATS IN HERE.
 > YES, THEY ARE ALL NEEDED. For instance, if you want to add immunity to something like mudslow, add fumudslow AND mudslow.
 > [0-Relative] means that THE STATS ARE ORIENTED AROUND 0. This means that the default state is 0. Values < 0 subtract from this stat, and values > 0 add to this stat. (e.g. -0.2 means "This stat -20% of its base value")
 > [1-Relative] means that THE STATS ARE ORIENTED AROUND 1. This means that the default state is 1 (100%). Values < 1 subtract from this stat, and values > 1 add to this stat. (e.g. 0.5 means "50% of this stat's value")
 > [Boolean] means that THE VALUE IS A SWITCH, AND MUST BE OFF (0) OR ON (1). No other values are legal.
