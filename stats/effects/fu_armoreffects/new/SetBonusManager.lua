    NOTE: In order to minimise the amount of looping through armour sets that
    is done here, we will assume that a set is complete if its "count" stat is
    3 and all others are zero. Therefore, if we encounter a "count" stat which
    is 1 or 2, this indicates the player is mixing different sets - and
    therefore must not wearing any full set. The practical use of this is that
    once we detect one nonzero "count" stat, we can check it first on
    subsequent updates without worrying if a different set is active.

  self.armorSets = root.assetJson("/stats/effects/fu_armoreffects/new/armorsets.config")
  self.activeSet = nil -- Currently active set bonus
  self.lastStat = nil -- Last detected "count" stat
  -- This line just removes any of the old persistent set bonus effects.
  status.clearPersistentEffects("setbonus")

      NOTE: If the player changes their equipped armour pieces one by one,
      will be nothing to do here as the update() script will have already
      removed any set bonuses. However, it is possible for the player to change
      all of their equipment at once using a mannequin. In this case, this
      script will be uninitialised before it can remove the set bonus.

      It would be ideal to call status.removeEphemeralEffect() to remove any
      remaining set bonuses here as a fallback case, but it seems that
      attempting to do so causes the Lua script to enter a recursion loop and
      crash the game. Using ephemeral effects here (instead of persistent ones)
      means that this is not a critical problem as the set bonus effect will
      expire on its own.

      But seriously, that's super weird. --wannas, Jul 2019
