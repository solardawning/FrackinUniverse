  -- FRACKIN RACES INTEGRATION --
  * FrackinRaces is now built into FU. There's no reason for it not to be, given that we add 13 races, plus the 7 from the game, and most users also have Elithian Races and Avali installed. (Lucca)
  * The above means, if you have FrackinRaces installed separately it must now be removed. You do not need it anymore.
  * On your ships SAIL, in the MISC section, you will find a new option to enable and disable Race Abilities. Note that some abilities may be hard-coded onto races and not remove (there may be edge cases), but most should disable if desired. These abilities are ON by default. (Lucca)
  * added back-end stats to support swapping race abilities (Lucca)
  * updated cat_primary.lua (Kherae)
  * veluu claw (razor claw) tech now spawns projectile based on mouth pos, so it looks less silly (Kherae)

  -- Combat --
  * Protection (armor) stat values above 100 will now have an effect. The effectiveness of Protection now caps at a stat value of 200. (solardawning)

  * adjusted food energy regen effects and tooltips, including fixing mint, which was 10x stronger than intended (50% instead of 5%). food energy regen effects are now (effect)/2 for energy regen and half that for energy regen block. IE: haleflower is 30% increased energy regen and 15% reduced energy regen block. (Kherae)

  -- Techs --
